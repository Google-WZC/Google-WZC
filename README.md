## Hi there 👋

I'm from China. My name is Wang Zichen. You can also call me Zachary. I was born in 2003 and am currently a master's student in Changsha.

I used to be in Department of Communication, however, researching AI. I am now a graduate student in integrated circuits. I like to do things I consider elegant, like publishing a top journal, solving a problem others haven't, or even achieving the mythical man-month. But I haven't achieved any of those things yet. So I keep studying hard.

I have to say this road is alone. I used to find solace in historical figures, but at my current age, I don't seem to feel that familiar feelings deeply anymore. Currently, I'm studying C and Verilog, and I also use Python for deep learning. There seems to be very little Verilog available on GitHub. I always feel like I write too little code a day, but I've never calculated how much I write on average. I also believe my coding skills are weak, but I feel that writing more code won't fundamentally improve my coding skills:( . Among you, a group of optimistic programmers, I'm a pessimist. So I can only assume that more code leads to more improvement, but I don't take that as a belief because I can't prove it.

My daily research focuses on hardware security and acceleration. Although I first encountered code (C) in my freshman year at the end of 2021, I think I truly witnessed its power during my junior year at the end of 2023. Python's power in pattern recognition and Jetbrain's elegant and playful interface fooled me into believing that this was real code. I even learned Java in July 2024. While I learned syntax like class polymorphism, it was a bit of a tangle. It wasn't until I discovered the books "The Hacker and the Painter" and "The Mythical Man-Month" through YSYX's open source project [https://github.com/OSCPU] that I finally open door of the Linux world, and that was only in July 2025. I feel like my coding career has only just begun, and my dreams are not far away.

I will occasionally post some technical blogs, but they are quite basic. If you think my work is helpful to you, please don't hesitate to give me a star as an encouragement to a pessimistic struggler. Let's see what I've done since then:
